    "Christmas Greetings"
    <br>
    This was our 2nd to the last activity in Website Developing , we are suppose to create letters and messages for our loved ones and friends for this christmas.
    In order to do that I recycled some of my codes and put some animation designs since it is only a screenshot of the output you can't barely see how it will function.
    I use HTML and CSS for this designs @w3schools.com. It helps me to express my feelings within this activity since I can secretly do a message with a suprise.

        "Minimum Health Protocol Signage"<br>
        Since it was covid-19 time when we are studying Website Developing we also need to create some covid-19 awareness website for the people and also to spread cautions.
        This was the my first activity where I use button functions like the log in box as you can see in the website it was a basic design. I am always using @w3schools.com as my source
        to my designs because its very accesible and free you can even test the code before you can apply to the compiler. Having these kind of activities can develop my skills in developing 
        and to have better creativity.

        "My Favorite Dishes"<br>
        Here is the activity where I start to use some image maps and css designs @w3schools.com. 
        All of the dishes that our favorite was being put in here and there are some recipes including the description of the recipe & etc.
        No pressure at that time and its also the start of discovering more designs within the subject. All of my worked outputs are individual because it was our activity
        and need to send in the lms.

        Lastly my first replicated work @Facebook this work composing in 1 month in duration but since Typhoon Odette comes the final activity was not being completed or neither submitted
        since no resources at that time 1 month no electricity and etc. but thank god since we are in a good health. Also it was the last worked output that I made in that subject but I still 
        practicing and apply more designs within my projects and other activities that can be design related.
